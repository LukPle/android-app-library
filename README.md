# About
The Android App Library is an open source project containing multiple apps. It is connected to the personal bachelor thesis of the repisotory owner [Lukas Plenk](https://github.com/LukPle) from the [Deggendorf Institute of Technology](https://www.th-deg.de/en). The anticipated platform for all source code is Android and the programming language is Java. 
# Goals
Learning different aspects of coding for Android can be tricky. Code examples often include to many features with sometimes outdated code snippets. This library should give everyone simple apps that diplay only a certain feature of Android. This makes the learning process more simple and easy to understand.
